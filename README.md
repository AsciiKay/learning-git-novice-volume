# learning-git-novice-volume
This repo contains explaination of basic commands and explaination of <strong>'git'</strong> <i>version control system</i>. <br/><br/>
Originally I created this repo. as test repo while <i><strong>learning 'git'!</strong></i>  <br/>
<strong>I'm no expert on 'git'</strong>  &&  this is <strong>not a comprehensive tutorial</strong>, but instead thought i should <br/>
share whatever I know!! <br/> <br/>
I guess that's best way to learn is to make other's understand whatever you know!  <br/>
